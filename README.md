# Introduction to Python Programming with Games

![Primoris Academy Logo](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/assets/img/primoris_logo.jpg "Primoris Academy") Spring 2015, Primoris Academy

This course is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of programming using the python language. The theme for this course will be games but the ultimate goal is to teach students how to examine a problem from the point of view of a programmer and then give them the tools to solve it. Games provide a way for someone with just about any interest to find a problem that interests them and then explore it. 
    
The course will start with learning how to set up a development environment, control flow statements in python and using basic data structures. These principles will be applied to developing different types of games every week. We will cover card games, arcade games, board games and RPGs. Each week will introduce new programming challenges and provide a platform for students to explore topics they are interested in like developing intricately detailed gameplay or applying their love of math to creating more challenging computer players. 
    
The course structure will consist of a weekly lecture based on the notes packet distributed with this course that will introduce the new topics for the week. Students will have a lab designed to be done in class with guidance from the instructor and then a take home problem set. All mini-projects will have suggestions for further development to help guide students who are interested in exploring the problem further. Students will also complete a long term project that they can either choose themselves or from a set of preselected ideas. The arc for this project will allow them to work with the instructor to break down their problem, plan how they will complete their project and then complete their project according to their plan. 


## Course Calendar

This is a tenative course calendar. 

### Week 1

The first week will cover everything needed to get started programming in python on Windows. We will start with learning how to install the python interpreter and use the python shell. Once we can execute python code, we will introduce the concept of version control and learn how to use GitHub. The class will end covering some basic features of the python langauge and we will write our first program.
