# Mario Game - Part 2

For this weeks walkthrough we'll be starting from a reference point and building features into our game. 

- Create a folder called `mario_game`
- Copy the code found [here](mario.py) into a file named `mario.py` in your folder
- Download the following images into the same folder
  - [mario.png](mario.png) 
  - [mario_background.jpg](mario_background.jpg) 
  - [koopa.png](koopa.png)
