Guessing Game
=============

We're going to create a guessing game in Scratch this week. 

Topics covered in this lab:

- Random Numbers
- Multibranch Conditionals
- State

Your game will start with generating a random number. The user will guess until they get this number. You will give them hints for higher or lower guesses. 


Generate Your Guess and Prompt the User
---------------------------------------

1. Create a variable to hold you random number and generate a number between 1 and 100. What do you think you should call this variable? Why?
2. The Cat will say: "I'm thinking of a number, what do you think it is?"
3. Create a variable to hold the users current guess. What do you think you should call this variable? 
4. Get the users input and store it in your guess variable. 


Give User Feedback
------------------

1. If the guess was right, tell them good job!
2. If the guess was wrong, tell them whether they were too high or too low.


High Score
----------

We will add a high score board in this part of the lab. 

1. Add a variable for the high scoring user's name
2. Add a variable for the high score
3. If the user's answer is right, compare it to the high score. 
4. If their answer is better than the high score, allow them to type in their name and save it to the name variable. Don't forget to save the new high score also!

What makes a score "better"? 


Expanding The Lab
-----------------

Here are some ideas to add more layers to this lab:
- Store more than one high score. If they get the second highest score you will need to bump all the other scores down the list
- Add difficulty levels. At level 1 the number go from 1 - 10, difficulty 2 they go from 1 - 100, at level 3 they go from 1 - 1000 and so on. Multiply the user's score by the difficulty level so if they play a harder game they get a higher score.
