=============


Version Control
---------------

Version control is software that tracks changes to files within a project over time. Regardless of project size, it is always wise to use version control of some type. It allows the developer to revert files or even the entire project to any state, track changes over time and when working in teams see who made what changes. 

For this class we are going to use a version control program called git. We will only explore a couple of the commands git provides in this class but it is a powerful tool used on large projects such as the Linux kernel, Arduino, and the Whitehouse Petitions site to name a few. 

A project in git is called a **repository**. Each lab for this course will be its own repository. Repositories are just like normal folders, they can contain more folders and files. 

When building complex programs, it is best to break the problem down into smaller pieces. The labs for this class will be mostly large problems broken down into smaller pieces. You will create a **commit** after you complete each part of your project. A commit is similar to a save point in a game. It allows you to go back to that point at anytime. You will give each commit a message saying what you did and changed. You can always go back and see what files changed between any two commits as well. 

You will only need to know six commands to get started working with git, and the GitHub client will provide a visual interface for all of them so you don't need to use the command line.
