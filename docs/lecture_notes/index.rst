Lecture Notes
=============

This chapter contains the lecture notes that go along with the course. For the most part they are divided by topic so many days may cover multiple sets of lecture notes. These notes are designed as much as possible to stand on their own without the need for the lecture so that they can be referenced later for review and help with concepts.
